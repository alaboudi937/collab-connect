# collab-connect

This website serves as a platform designed to the needs of students with innovative project ideas who are seeking collaborative opportunities with fellow students, colleagues, and friends. For instance, if a student wishes to develop new fabrication technology for spacesuits, this platform enables them to share comprehensive project details, including requirements, objectives, preferences, and other relevant information.

Furthermore, a key feature of this website is the tagging system. Project initiators can specify their requirements, such as the need for individuals skilled in APIs or chemical engineering. By using tags, individuals seeking projects can easily locate opportunities aligned with their expertise. This approach shares some resemblance to GitHub, with an exclusive focus on geographical closeness.

This platform goes beyond the realm of virtual collaboration and extends its reach to in-person interactions as well. For instance, a student from the University of Michigan-Dearborn can post a project, affording the opportunity for students from other institutions, such as Wayne State University, to participate in and contribute to that project. The emphasis here lies in fostering geographical closeness, which not only encourages direct collaboration but also opens the door to a wealth of additional resources and shared expertise.

The primary objective of this website is to optimize project efficiency and foster effortless collaboration among students, functioning as a unifying bridge that connects individuals and unlocks a wealth of opportunities. Additionally, this platform will incorporate Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and professors who can be readily reached for project-specific consultations and pre-scheduled meetings. In the long run, our vision is to expand the reach of this platform to numerous colleges and universities, bolstering support for a multitude of student organizations.
